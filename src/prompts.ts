- The type of sound (e.g., "wooden door creaking open slowly")
- Duration and timing (e.g., "a short 2-second burst")
- Environment and ambience (e.g., "in a large cathedral with echo")
- Intensity and dynamics (e.g., "starting quiet and building to loud")
Specific, descriptive prompts produce much better results than vague ones.`;
